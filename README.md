# TensorFlow Examples

This project use TensorFlow framework to do many interesting applications. Many popular deep leaning architecture will be implemented is this project, including Neural Networks, RNN, LSTM, Auto-encoder, CNN, etc.

## Examples

 1. [Sentiment Classification](./1_Sentiment_Classification/README.md)

 2. [Poetry Generate](./2_RNN_Poetry_generate/README.md)

 3. [Char RNN](./3_Char_RNN/README.md)

 Use Char_RNN to generate Enlighs sentence trained with tiny shakespeare corpus.

 4. [Chitchat Bot](./4_Chitchat/README.md)

 Use movie dialog corpus to train a simple chit chat bot.

 5. [LSTM for Text Classification](./5_LSTM_Text_Classification/README.md)

 Use LSTM model to classify texts, including char level and word level.

## Environment
